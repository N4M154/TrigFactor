        The History of Trigonometry
      </h1>

          Trigonometry, the branch of mathematics that studies relationships
          involving lengths and angles of triangles, has a rich and fascinating
          history that dates back to ancient civilizations.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg mb-4">
          The origins of trigonometry can be traced to ancient Egypt and Babylon
          around 1900 BCE, where early mathematicians used geometric methods to
          solve practical problems related to astronomy and land surveying.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg mb-4">
          However, the development of trigonometry as a distinct branch of
          mathematics is often attributed to the Greeks. The Greek mathematician
          Hipparchus, around 150 BCE, is considered the "father of
          trigonometry." He compiled the first known trigonometric table, which
          was used to solve astronomical problems.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg mb-4">
          The work of the Greeks was later expanded upon by Indian
          mathematicians such as Aryabhata and Bhaskara, who made significant
          contributions to trigonometric functions and identities. The concept
          of sine, cosine, and tangent functions were introduced during this
          period.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg mb-4">
          In the Islamic Golden Age (8th to 14th centuries), scholars such as
          Al-Khwarizmi and Al-Battani further developed trigonometry,
          incorporating it into their astronomical studies. They introduced the
          use of trigonometric functions in solving spherical triangles, which
          was crucial for navigation and astronomy.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg mb-4">
          The Renaissance period saw the revival of trigonometry in Europe, with
          mathematicians like Johannes Kepler and Isaac Newton applying
          trigonometric principles to their work in astronomy and calculus.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg mb-4">
          Today, trigonometry is a fundamental part of mathematics, with
          applications spanning from engineering and physics to computer
          graphics and signal processing. Its development over the centuries
          reflects the evolving nature of mathematics and its application to
          understanding the world around us.
